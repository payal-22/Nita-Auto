# AUTO-MATE
An app designed to help students efficiently coordinate shared auto rides from college to the city. It solves the issue of high fares when autos are not filled with 5 passengers. Users can create profiles, log in, and view a real-time graph displaying the number of students heading to the city versus time. They can add their trip details, update the graph, and interact with others through comments to organize rides together, saving both time and money.

- **Add Trip Details**:

- **View Graph**: Graph showing the number of people traveling vs. time.
